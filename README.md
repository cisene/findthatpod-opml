# FindThatPod - OPML

This is an OPML representation of the [FindThatPod](https://findthatpod.com/) newsletter emails that arrive every friday with podcast suggestions and recommendations.

All the material of the newsletters are property of FindThatPod, I have just rendererd an [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) out of them and make no claims to their work.

Go to the [FindThatPod](https://findthatpod.com/) for more information.





I just created something I would like to consume myself, lists without links are useless, an [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) can be fed into just ANY podcast catcher and be used right away.
